// TODO: Create a contract which holds the monthly bounty amount.
// Team can fund the vault.
// Team can award points to contributors.
// Contributors can make claims to get points (and put a deposit). This leads to disputes with the team.
// People can challenge points of contributors (and put a deposit). If they win their challenges, points are removed.
// At the end of the month (and of the disputes, if there is any), the bounty is split between contributors in proportion of their points.
